# Chip8 Emulator

One day I got really intrigued about emulators so I read a lot about it and implemented the [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).
It is usually the first emulator someone would implement due to it's simplicity.
I implemented it all from scratch based on the specs I found on the internet.
It was one of the most interesting and fun programming project I did!

After that, I wanted to implement the [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System), but it turns out that this is much more complicated and so I only ended up making a disassembler for the [6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) (the CPU of the NES).
